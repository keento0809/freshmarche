## Technologies

- `React` - version 17.0.2
- `MaterialUI` - version 5.5.0
- `Stripe` - version 8.216.0

## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to start running the app

## Approach

- Utilize React.js and Redux with Typescript to make state management easier and improve the efficiency of developing the application thanks to the power of Typescript.
- Introducing `react-simple-map`, a library for React.js showcasing the world map with countries filled with colors where users have been before.
- Users can search countries using the search bar on the nav section or looking for them from regions via the 'countries' link on the home page.
- Adding features such as registrations to add countries to the bucket list (list of countries where users would like to visit in their future) and to the records (list of countries where users have been to) respectively utilizing the cloud firestore (firebase) as the database.
- Being considered to have a good user interface and is designed by `TailWind CSS` and `DaisyUI`, a third-party library for Tailwind CSS.

## Status

[FreshMarche](https://freshmarche.vercel.app/home) is still in progress to improve.
